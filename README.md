# Drip Irrigation
# abstract
Drip irrigation is more effective and less expensive if a large amount of soil can be wetted with each emitter without losing water or nutrients below the root zone. The distance that water spreads horizontally from a drip line and the volume of soil wetted are limiting factors that determine the spacing and number of drip lines and emitters, the frequency of irrigation, and thus the cost of irrigation. We used numerical simulations and field trials to investigate the effects of application rate, pulsed water application, and antecedent water content on the spreading of water from drip emitters. Simulation results showed that pulsing and lower application rates produced minor increases in horizontal spreading at the end of water application. The small increases were primarily due to longer irrigation times, however, and not to flow phenomena associated with pulsing or low application rates. Moreover, the small increases mostly disappeared after the infiltrated water had redistributed for a period of 24 h. Field trials confirmed the simulation findings, with no statistically significant difference in wetting being found among five water application treatments involving pulsed applications and varying application rates. The simulations showed that higher antecedent water content increases water spreading from drip irrigation systems, but the increases were greater in the vertical direction than in the horizontal, an undesirable outcome if crop roots are shallow or groundwater contamination is a concern. Overall, soil texture (hydraulic properties) and antecedent water content largely determine the spreading and distribution of a given water application, with pulsing and flow rate having very little impact.

# System Overview
The main component of the setup is the Nodemcu ESP8266 module. All the other hardware components are connected to the Nodemcu. The board is programmed in Arduino IDE and uses the ESP8266, Adafruit MQTT libraries. These libraries have been added to the Arduino IDE. 

# Programming NodeMCU and Setting Up Adafruit Dashboard
* Import Adafruit Library to the Arduino IDE
* Fill your Adafruit token, ssid, and wifi password to the code.
* Upload drip irrigation code to your NodeMCU

* Setup your Adafruit dashboard, add a custom widget, choose two state widget and give it name.
